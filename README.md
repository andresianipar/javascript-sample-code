# JavaScript Sample Code
This repository serves as documentation for the code I wrote while learning JavaScript. The sample code is taken from [Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd Edition: A Modern Introduction to Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-3rd-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593279507/ref=zg_bs_3617_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=YGWZY0ZXXKE97APY6YRH).
